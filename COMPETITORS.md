## Competitive Positioning

### What Competitors DON'T Do Well

| Gap | Opportunity |
|-----|-------------|
| **Document-level checklists** | Most just say "visa required" — not what docs you need |
| **Fees by nationality** | Rarely show reciprocity fees |
| **Validity by nationality** | Generic or missing |
| **Sources cited** | Most don't link to official sources |
| **Free validation** | Processing services charge; info sites are shallow |
